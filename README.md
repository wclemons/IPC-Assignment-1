Language Used: C++

How to execute the program:
1) unzip the files on a linux machine by typing "tar -xvf '351-Assignment1.tar'
2) cd into the newly unzipped file directory '351-Assignment1.tar'
3) type "make" into the command line to automatically compile sender and reciever files
4) This will produce output files: "sender" and "recv"
5) You will need either 2 tabs or 2 terminals to complete the execution. In one tab, run the sender file by typing "./sender keyfile.txt"
6) run the receiver file by typing "./recv"
7) type ls to view the newly created file with the outputted message
8) type "cat recvfile" to view the contents of the file in your terminal

We have not done the extra credit.
Nothing stands out in our project at this time.
